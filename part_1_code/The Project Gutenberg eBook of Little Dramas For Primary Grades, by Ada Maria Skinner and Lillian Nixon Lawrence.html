  <h2 class="c008">PREFATORY NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p class="c009">The use of dramatic readers has passed beyond
the experimental stage. Their value in
arousing interest, in stirring the imagination, in
quickening literary appreciation and power of
interpretation, has been so clearly demonstrated
as to make them permanent textbooks in the
elementary schools, and more particularly in the
primary grades. The present difficulty consists,
therefore, not in uncertainty of the value of dramatic
literature, but in the inadequacy of the
supply. The need of suitable literary material
in good dramatic form for the primary grades is
still very great. This little book has been compiled
as one step toward meeting this need at
least in one particular school, but it is hoped that
it may prove of service in many other schools.
It is intended for use at the end of the first, and
at the beginning of the second, year.</p>

    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Odd Man.</em></span>

    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Big Black Dog.</em></span>

      Oh, sir, it was a big black dog. It came into the cave and was stealing a bone.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Odd Man.</em></span>
      Oh! That was the ogre in the dress of a black dog. Here, you may have a bone. You were a
      good dog to bark and wake me up. What more can I do to show you how glad I am?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>True.</em></span>
      Oh, sir, may I go out of the cave now? I want to see a nice, nice cat that is waiting
      outside.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Odd Man.</em></span>
      Very well, good dog. The ogre will not come back again, and I can take a good nap. Here
      is a door in the side of the cave. I will open it, and you can go.—Good-by.</p>

    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Tin Soldier.</em></span>

    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>French Doll.</em></span>
      Old, sir? How can you say that? Just look at me! If my hair were combed and I had a new

      Yes, I’m quite sure you would be very pretty.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Tin Soldier.</em></span>

      and a fresh gun.</p>

      Yes, some one broke it off. Now if I had a new trunk, I’d be all right. But look at the

      him look new again.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Tiger.</em></span>

      [<em>In a whisper.</em>] My voice is almost gone. Some one punched me too hard once and

      your squeak then, little mice.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Jack-in-the-box.</em></span>
      I never could get back after my lid came off. A hinge and a few screws, and I’d be as

      Here I am!</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Old Year.</em></span>
      Oh, there you are, are you? Come in and let us have a look at you, and shut the door,
      please, after you.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>New Year.</em></span>
      Frosty night! Fine and clear. I’ve had a pleasant journey.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Old Year.</em></span>
      Humph! I don’t expect to find <em>mine</em> pleasant. A long cold drive, I call it. But
      to be sure, I thought it pleasant when I was your age, youngster! Is the sleigh waiting?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>New Year.</em></span>
      Yes, but there is no hurry. Wait a bit and tell me how matters are in these parts.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Old Year.</em></span>
      [<em>Shaking his head.</em>] So, so! They <span class="pageno" id="Page_74">74</span>might be better and yet they might be
      worse, too. They were worse before I came, much worse. I have done a great deal. Now I
      expect you, my boy, to do just as I did. Be a good year all the way through.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>New Year.</em></span>
      I shall do my best, you may be sure. And now tell me a little what there is to do.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Old Year.</em></span>
      In the first place, you have the weather to attend to. You see the seasons have a way of
      running into each other and getting mixed, if you don’t keep a sharp lookout on them. The
      months, too, are a troublesome set. Then you must be careful how you turn on wet and
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_75">75</span>dry weather. And one thing I want you to do very carefully—watch the leaves that are
      turned.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>New Year.</em></span>
      I thought Autumn attended to that sort of thing!</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Old Year.</em></span>
      Oh, I don’t mean leaves of trees. You know that at the beginning of a year half the
      people in the world say, “I am going to turn over a new leaf!” They mean that they are
      going to be better than they have ever been before. But leaves do not stay turned over. I
      know a great many little boys who said they were going to turn over new leaves. They were
      not going to tear their clothes, nor lose their jackknives, <span class="pageno" id="Page_76">76</span>nor bring mud into
      the house on their boots. And the little girls were going to keep their rooms tidy and
      their buttons sewed on. But I haven’t seen much change in most of them.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>New Year.</em></span>
      I’ll attend to that. Anything else?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Old Year.</em></span>
      Above all, take care of the children. Give them all the good weather you can. And now the
      horses are ready to go. My time is nearly up, so I start on my long drive. You will find
      everything in pretty good shape. Well, well, my boy, good-by, good luck to you.</p>

      In the jungle I met a camel. He carried two sacks of gold on his back. They were so heavy
      that he could not lie down. He asked me to seek his fortune, too.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Wise Man.</em></span>
      Take the sacks off his back. Then he will be free, and <span class="pageno" id="Page_81">81</span>you will have the gold.
      Why did you not do it before?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Man.</em></span>
      I was thinking only of myself. After that I met a tiger. For many days he has had a thorn
      in his foot. He cannot rest. He asked me to seek his fortune, too.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Wise Man.</em></span>
      Take the thorn out of his foot, and both of you will gain by it. Why did you not think of
      this before?</p>

    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Mrs. Sparrow.</em></span>
      Yes, it seemed in a great hurry to go. It did the same <span class="pageno" id="Page_87">87</span>thing last year when the

    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Mr. Sparrow.</em></span>
      Yes, yes, it always does—and don’t you know why? How could the little worms and green

      we do for good things to eat?</p>

      Why do they keep me here? No one to talk to, no one to play with, no trees to climb. Only
      one friend, the jellyfish with his hard shell. I’d like him better if he hadn’t one. It
      makes me think of that bad turtle that brought me down here on his hard back. Here comes
      the old jellyfish now.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Jellyfish.</em></span>
      Hello, Monkey, you look sad.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Monkey.</em></span>

<span class="pageno" id="Page_126">126</span>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Jellyfish.</em></span>
      Poor Monkey! I am sorry for you. But of course you must stay here until they come to get
      you.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Monkey.</em></span>
      Until who comes to get me?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Jellyfish.</em></span>
      The fish, of course. Don’t you know?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Monkey.</em></span>
      Indeed, I don’t, Jellyfish. What do you mean?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Jellyfish.</em></span>
      They want your heart for the queen. In a few days they’ll come and kill you and give her
      your heart to eat.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Monkey.</em></span>
      Oh, dear me! Give my heart to the queen to eat? Why, Jellyfish, do you know what you are
      talking about? What wrong have I done that I should be killed?</p>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_127">127</span>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Jellyfish.</em></span>
      Oh, you’ve done no wrong. But our dear queen is very ill, and your heart is the only
      thing that will cure her. We cannot get your heart unless we kill you; so try and be
      brave about it.</p>

      [<em>To himself.</em>] I shall not give my heart to the queen. I must get away from here
      somehow. But how? I do not know the way. Only the turtle could take me back, and he
      won’t. What can I do? Here comes the turtle now.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Turtle.</em></span>
      You look sad, Monkey. What is the matter?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Monkey.</em></span>
      Dear me, Turtle, I was <span class="pageno" id="Page_128">128</span>just thinking of something I have left at home that I
      need very much.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Turtle.</em></span>
      Indeed! What is it, dear Monkey?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Monkey.</em></span>
      It’s my heart, Turtle. Just before I left home I hung it out on a bush to dry. If the
      rain comes, it will be spoiled.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Turtle.</em></span>
      What is this you tell me?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Monkey.</em></span>
      It’s about my heart. Some one must carry me back to the land so that I can get it.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Turtle.</em></span>
      Well, well, is there no other way? Then I must take you back to get your heart. That is
      the best plan, and we must start at once. Come. [<em>They go out together.</em>]</p>

      Dear Queen, I am very sad, and very cold, and very ill. My <span class="pageno" id="Page_130">130</span>poor body is without

      You are very kind, Turtle.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Turtle.</em></span>
      I took him on my back. When we got to the land he sprang off my back and up the nearest
      tree. He told his brothers what had happened to him. Then they all rushed at me. They
      tore off my shell and threw my body back into the sea without it.</p>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_131">131</span>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Queen Osa.</em></span>
      Poor Turtle! Never mind. I’ll give you another shell, for you did your best. Some one
      must have been telling the monkey tales. Jellyfish, you were his friend. Do you know
      anything about this?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Jellyfish.</em></span>
      I told the monkey that we were going to kill him so that we could get his heart for you.
      I told him to try and be brave about it.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Queen Osa.</em></span>
      You are to blame, then, Jellyfish, for all this trouble. To punish you for meddling, I

      Dear, dear, there goes one of my finest dumplings rolling down the hill. That will never

      Good morning! Yes, I saw a dumpling. It went past here. It went down the hill skipping as

    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Sanja.</em></span>
      Oh, thank you. Then I must skip after it.</p>

    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Third Lord Jizu.</em></span>

      That is not strange. I saw the dumpling rolling my way. I caught it and ate it. It was

    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Ogre.</em></span>
      Because it was good.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Sanja.</em></span>
      You couldn’t eat me for that reason. Tee-hee-hee!</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Ogre.</em></span>

    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Lion.</em></span>
      Very well—begin.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Fox.</em></span>
      There was once a fisherman who went to sea. He had a large net. He spread it out far and
      wide. One day a great many fish got into the net. Just as the fisherman was about to draw
      it up, the cords broke, and a small hole was made in the side of the net. Now, this hole
      was just large enough for one fish <span class="pageno" id="Page_171">171</span>to slip through at a time. So, one fish got
      out—[<em>Fox stops.</em>]</p>
    </div>

      Yes?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Fox.</em></span>
      Then two fishes got out. [<em>Fox stops.</em>]</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Lion.</em></span>
      What then?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Fox.</em></span>
      Then three escaped. [<em>Fox stops.</em>]</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Lion.</em></span>
      [<em>Impatiently.</em>] Yes, yes! but the story? I tell you, go on with the story. What
      then?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Fox.</em></span>
      Then four fishes got out.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Lion.</em></span>
      Come, come, sir, you are not telling me anything new.</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Fox.</em></span>
      O King! Each lot of fishes was different from the rest.—Then the hole grew a little
      larger and—</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Lion.</em></span>
      But, wherein is the wonder?</p>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_173">173</span>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Fox.</em></span>
      Why, your majesty, what can be more wonderful than for fish to escape in lots, each lot
      greater than the other by one?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Lion.</em></span>
      [<em>Impatiently.</em>] How long will it take all those fishes to get out?</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Fox.</em></span>
      O King Lion, it was a large net—there were thousands and thousands of fishes in it.—Then
      the hole grew a little larger and—</p>
    <p><span class="dl_1"><em>Lion.</em></span>
      Stop, stop! I can not stand this. Leave my court at once—anything to stop those fishes.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
